## Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - As a programming language.
* [Exo Player](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) - As a media player and more features.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - For multithreading while handling requests to the server and local database.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - To handle app navigation.

* [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.
* [Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Offers an implementation of observer design pattern.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - notifies views of any database changes in an observer way.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - It is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - It is arguably the most used Dependency Injection, or DI, framework for Android. Many Android projects use Dagger to simplify building and providing dependencies across the app. It gives you the ability to create specific scopes, modules, and components, where each forms a piece of a puzzle: The dependency graph.

# Note:
 - I maked this app to just work with exo player and how to make a stream song. for this reason it's not big much and i use  just firebase.
